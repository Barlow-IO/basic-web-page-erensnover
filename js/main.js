 * the $ is just jQuery looking slick. jQuery makes a variable named `$`

// YOUR MISSION:
/* Every time #memeButton is clicked, it should go to the next meme,
 * it can choose a meme at random or it can just go based on an order
 * also make a button to add/remove the `pink` class from #meme
 * this should use jQuery's `addClass` and `removeClass` functions
