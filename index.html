<!--

Hey guys! Get read to make your first web page, it's going to hopefully be
easy *and* fun! WOOOAHH

I've laid out a skeleton for you work with, there's a few basic element with
comments to explain what they do.

 -->

<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Basic Web Page</title>
  <meta name="Author" content=""/>
  <!-- This is a stylesheet, it's going to use css to style your page -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/style.css">
  <!-- The elements have an attribute named "href" which is the path of the file they load -->

</head>
<body>
  <!-- Everything should go inside your body element, except the footer -->

  <div class="wrapper">
    <!-- A div is a container, it holds stuff -->

    <div class="">
      <h1>Welcome to the internet</h1>

      <div class="wrapper">
        <br> <!-- br is a line break -->
        <img class="center" id="meme" src="img/surfboard.jpg" alt="welcome to the internet... I will be your guide" />
        <br>
      </div>

      <p>
        Mess aroung with this web page a bit, maybe so something fun with javascript <br>
        Oh hey... go check out main.js! (but click the button first)
      </p>

      <br><br>

      <button type="button" id="memeButton">I do javascript</button>

    </div>
  </div>
</body>

<!-- This is a script element, it runs javascript files javascript makes your page do stuff -->
<!-- We put it at the bottom of the page because we're letting all the lelements load first
     then we'll change the elements with javascript. try putting the scripts at the top -->
<script src="lib/jquery-2.1.4.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<script src="js/main.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

</html>
